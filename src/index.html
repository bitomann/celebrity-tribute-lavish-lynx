            <!-- <p>Freddie Mercury 'The King'</p> -->
        </div>

        <p> Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991) was a British singer,
            songwriter, record producer, and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest lead
            singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal
            range.</p>

        <p> Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi parents from India, he attended English-style boarding schools in India
            from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar
            Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in
            1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including
            "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody to Love", "We Are the Champions", "Don't Stop Me Now", and
            "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the
            audience, such as the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest
            musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS. He confirmed the
            day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. In 1992, a tribute
            concert was held at Wembley Stadium.
        </p>

        <p> As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the
            Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen
            members were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his
            death Mercury was awarded it individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding
            Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury ranked
            number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.</p>

        <p>Over the years Freddie collaborated with the likes of Andrew Gold (Never 'Let Her Slip Away', 1978), David
            Bowie ('Under Pressure', 1981), Billy Squier ('Emotions in Motion', 1982), and 'Victory', 'There Must Be
            More to Life Than This', and 'State of Shock' were recorded by Mercury and Michael Jackson, but their
            original takes were never released. Demos and samples from the latter two have, however, turned up on
            bootlegs. Later, Mercury reworked "There Must Be More to Life Than This" into his solo album Mr. Bad Guy,
            and Jackson re-recorded "State of Shock" with Mick Jagger. Popular rumours dictate that a Queen version of
            "Victory" exists, but this has not surfaced anywhere yet. Queen's 2014 compilation Queen Forever included a
            brand new arrangement of "There Must Be More to Life Than This" featuring cuts from Jackson's vocal track.
