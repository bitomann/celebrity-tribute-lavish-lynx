            <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical drama film about Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British
                rock
                band Queen. It was directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and produced by
                Graham King
                and Queen manager Jim Beach. It stars Rami Malek as Mercury, with Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy,
                Joe
                Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech, and Mike Myers in supporting roles. Queen members
                Brian May
                and Roger Taylor served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by 20th
                Century Fox,
                Regency Enterprises, GK Films, and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the
                singer's
                life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 Live Aid performance at the original Wembley
                Stadium.</p>

            <p>Bohemian Rhapsody was announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen set to play Mercury. After he left the
                project
                in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before
                Malek was
                cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of principal photography, which began
                in
                London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and
                crew.
                Dexter Fletcher, who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete
                the film,
                although Singer retained sole director credit as per Directors Guild of America guidelines. Fletcher
                received an
                executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.</p>
