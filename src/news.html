            <h3>Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)</h3>
            <img class="bohemian_image"
                src="https://image-ticketfly.imgix.net/00/03/15/70/01-og.jpg?w=500&h=334&fit=crop&crop=top">

            <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical drama film about Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British
                rock
                band Queen. It was directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and produced by
                Graham King
                and Queen manager Jim Beach. It stars Rami Malek as Mercury, with Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy,
                Joe
                Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech, and Mike Myers in supporting roles. Queen members
                Brian May
                and Roger Taylor served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by 20th
                Century Fox,
                Regency Enterprises, GK Films, and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the
                singer's
                life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 Live Aid performance at the original Wembley
                Stadium.</p>

            <p>Bohemian Rhapsody was announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen set to play Mercury. After he left the
                project
                in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before
                Malek was
                cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of principal photography, which began
                in
                London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and
                crew.
                Dexter Fletcher, who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete
                the film,
                although Singer retained sole director credit as per Directors Guild of America guidelines. Fletcher
                received an
                executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.<br><br>

            <img class="tour_image"
                src="https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Ffiles%2Fmedia%2Fdam-Lambert-performs-live-with-Brian-May-of-Queen-2014-a-billlboard-1548.jpg">
            <p>Following the success of the music biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, original Queen band members Brian May and
                Roger Taylor are heading out on a 23-show tour with Adam Lambert.

                The new show will push production boundaries, continuing to celebrate the innovation of Queen’s music
                and featuring the band’s most popular hits. “We have been designing a brand new visual spectacle that
                will reframe these iconic songs and we are excited to unveil it!” said Lambert in a statement.

                The Rhapsody tour kicks off July 10 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, BC. After cruising across the county,
                making stops at arenas including The Forum in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York, the
                tour will wrap up at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C. on Aug. 23.

                Tickets for the general public will go on sale at 10:00 a.m. local time on Dec. 7 at LiveNation.com.
                Queen and Adam Lambert Fan Club Presales will run from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. local time on Dec. 6.

                Adam Lambert Makes a Cameo in Freddie Mercury Biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'
                “Our last tour featured our most ambitious production ever, and got out best notices ever,” said
                guitarist May. “So we decided to rip it apart and get even more ambitious! Watch out, America!"

                Queen first teamed up with Lambert in 2009 during the American Idol finale and first shared a
                full-length show with him in Ukraine alongside Elton John in 2012. Their partnership ignited, and they
                have since performed over 180 concerts together.</p>

            <h3>Brian May and Queen ‘to perform Live Aid-style gig’ for Australia wildfire victims</h3>
            <img class="benefit_image"

            <p>The 72-year-old guitarist is due to head to Australia in the coming months with his musical outfit
                Queen
                + Adam Lambert, but admitted that the current situation meant new factors had to be considered. ‘Of
                course, we are going there very soon,’ he told PA, ‘We are looking at it very carefully. ‘We have been
                approached to do a benefit concert, or be part of a benefit concert, a bit like Live Aid, if you like,
                to try and help out the victims of the fire.’ Sounds incredible. A keen animal activist, with ending
                badger culling being his main cause in the UK, the impact the wildfires are having on Australia’s
                wildlife was a particular blow for Brian after it was announced more than a billion creatures had died
                in the blazes. Queen currently perform with Adam Miller (Picture: Noam Galai/Getty) ‘Of course, I am
                very concerned about the animals,’ he continued. ‘There’s 24 people who have died, which is a tragedy in
                itself, but [the number of animals] is almost inconceivable. ‘You are looking at a radical change of
                wildlife in Australia. It’s like a mass extinction, which is something so awful. And we can do nothing
                about it really. We could have done something about it in the past. ‘We know there are various things
                that could have been done. But it is a real caution for the rest of the world.’
